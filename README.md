## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mehdi, a current sophomore @ UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). I've spent the better part of the last half-decade solving problems through code, everything from building apps to help local communities to creating AI-powered glasses to help the blind see.

You can check out some of my projects right here on github or go over to my website at mehdi.us!
